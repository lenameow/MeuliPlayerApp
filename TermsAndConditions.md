**Terms & Conditions**

By downloading or using the Meuli Media Player app ("the App"), the terms & conditions on this page will automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the App. 

**General Terms**

We want our App to be safe, secure, and comply with the law, so we need you to commit to the restrictions below before downloading or using the App:

* You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of the App under applicable laws.
* You cannot do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorized purpose.
* You cannot do anything to impair or interfere with the intended operation of the App.
* You agree not to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks, if any, in any way. 
* You agree that we install updates to the App on your device.
* You agree not to attempt to extract the source code of the App. You also shouldnâ€™t try to make derivative versions of the App, or translate the App into other languages. 
* You acknowledge that and agree that you are fully responsible for managing your "in-app" purchases.

**The Data Policy**

The Privacy Policy explains how we use information. We do not collect, store, process, use, or perform any other actions with the personal data of our users. All information and data are stored on the user's device or iCloud. We do, however, use Sentry to collect analytics data to discover performance issues. We do not collect any personally identifiable information, like user names or email addresses. 
[Sentry's Data Policy for Mobile](https://docs.sentry.io/product/security/mobile-privacy/)

**"In-app" Purchases**

The App includes "in-app" purchases that allow you to use advanced features, such as enjoying unlimited number of playlists, and edit augmented fields of ID3 tags. It will not be necessary to make any "in-app" purchases in order to use the basic functions. Payments will be processed through the iTunes App Store. You may access the applicable "in-app" purchase rules and policies directly from the App Store.

Whilst you cannot switch off "in-app" purchases from being offered to you within the app, you can switch off/manage your ability to complete "in-app" purchases by altering the settings on the device you use for this app. You acknowledge that and agree that you are fully responsible for managing your "in-app" purchases.

If you are under 18 then you must have your parents' or guardians' permission to make any "in-app" purchases. By completing an "in-app" purchase, you are confirming to us that you have any and all permission that may be necessary in order to allow you to make that "in-app" purchase.

**Third Party Library Usage**

See [Legal Notices](LegalNotices.md).

**Other Terms**

If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect. Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you.

This agreement does not give rights to any third parties. You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent. Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes, as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by law.

Our Meuli Media Player App is provided "as is", and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. To the extent permitted by law, we also disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We also don't control what people and others do or say, and we aren't responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren't responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our app. Our responsibility for anything that happens on the app (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our app, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes the situation when we delete your content or information.

We appreciate your feedback or suggestions, and may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for these feedback or suggestions. We are under no obligation to keep them confidential either.

**Changes to This Terms and Conditions**

We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective since 2024-01-15.
