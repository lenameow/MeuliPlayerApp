Meuli Media Player is an offline player that easily plays local media files.

As long as you have music or videos in the Files App (whether obtained through AirDrop or saved from other apps), Meuli Media Player can help you organize them into playlists and enjoy, either on the screen or in the background.

Meuli Media Player uses MobileVLCKit v[] for decoding certain formats. The library is integrated through CocoaPods. Detailed information regarding this library see CocoaPods - MobileVLCKit and VLCKit Official Site.
