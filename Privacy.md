**Privacy Policy**

We built the Meuli Media Player app as a Freemium app. The Service is provided by us and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

We do not ask for personal or private information like names, email addresses, or payment information. Since we never have access to your personal information, we cannot and do not share it with third parties. 

We do not collect, store, process, use, or perform any other actions with the data generated during our Service in any server. All data related to our Service are stored on the user's device and in personal iCloud.

We do, however, use Sentry to collect analytics data to discover performance issues. We do not collect any personally identifiable information, like user names or email addresses. 

Users may refer to the privacy policy site of Sentry to gain detailed and updated information:

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
